## Impact Assessment

### ‚úÖ What Still Works
- Quiz creation and editing (all other fields)
- Quiz attempts and scoring
- Quiz visibility and permissions
- Time limits and attempt limits
- All existing quiz functionality

### üóëÔ∏è What Was Removed
- Quiz mode selection in create/edit forms
- Quiz mode display in quiz statistics
- Quiz mode-based behavior differentiation
- Quiz mode validation in APIs

### üìä Database Schema Changes
**Before:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE community_quiz (
  -- ... other fields ...
  quiz_mode text CHECK (quiz_mode IN ('practice', 'strict')) DEFAULT 'practice',
  -- ... other fields ...
);
```

**After:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE community_quiz (
  -- ... other fields ...
  -- quiz_mode field completely removed
  -- ... other fields ...
);
```

## Migration Instructions

### For Development Environment
1. Run the migration script: `db/migrations/20250924_remove_quiz_mode_field.sql`
2. Update any local database schemas
3. Clear any cached API responses that might contain quiz_mode

### For Production Environment
1. **BACKUP DATABASE FIRST**
2. Run the migration script during maintenance window
3. Verify all quiz functionality works correctly
4. Monitor for any API errors related to missing quiz_mode

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Quiz creation works without quiz_mode
- [ ] Quiz editing works without quiz_mode
- [ ] Quiz display shows correct information
- [ ] API responses don't include quiz_mode
- [ ] Database queries execute without errors
- [ ] Full-text search works correctly
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] No runtime JavaScript errors

## Rollback Plan
If rollback is needed:
1. Restore database from backup
2. Revert all code changes using git
3. Re-add quiz_mode field to database schema
4. Update APIs to include quiz_mode again

## Notes
- This removal is **irreversible** once the migration runs in production
- All existing quizzes will lose their mode information
- No business logic currently depends on quiz_mode differentiation
- The removal simplifies the quiz system and reduces UI complexity
