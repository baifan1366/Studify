-- SECURITY NOTES
-- =========================

/*
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
1. All tables use Row Level Security (RLS) policies defined separately
2. UUID public_id fields prevent enumeration attacks
3. Soft deletion with is_deleted flags for data recovery
4. Audit logging for administrative actions
5. Role-based access control via profiles.role field
6. OneSignal integration uses secure player ID mapping
7. QStash integration uses secure webhook validation
8. Embedding system isolates content processing
9. Video processing uses secure token-based queue system
10. Quiz sessions use unique tokens for security

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Comprehensive indexing on frequently queried columns
2. Vector indexes for embedding similarity search
3. Composite indexes for common query patterns
4. Partial indexes for filtered queries
5. GIN indexes for array and JSONB columns
6. Text search indexes for full-text search
7. Foreign key indexes for join performance

MAINTENANCE NOTES:
1. Use cleanup functions for old sessions and logs
2. Monitor embedding queue processing
3. Track dual embedding coverage statistics
4. Regular vacuum and analyze for vector indexes
5. Monitor video processing queue performance
6. Archive old audit logs and delivery logs
